For enforcing code style and utilizing static code analyzing we use ESLint along with a bunch of rulesets. The most noteworthy ruleset is the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/).

We chose this approach because it provides strict but conventional rules. You can always execute the commands `pnpm format` to apply the Prettier formatting settings for all project files inside the `src`-directory, or `pnpm lint` to lint all projects files inside the `src`-directory based on the ESLint configuration.
