### Preparations

The repository requires Node version 18, which is in [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule) until **30.04.2025**. It can be easily installed via the [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) following the setup in the `README.md`. Besides, you need the package manager `pnpm`, which can be installed with `npm install --global pnpm` (will be installed globally).

### Setup

Before the environment setup is complete, you need to run `pnpm setup` inside the project folder (at root-level). The script will automatically install all repository dependencies and enable husky for pre-commit linting.
