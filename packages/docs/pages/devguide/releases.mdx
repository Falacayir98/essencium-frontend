### Build a new release

A build can be created by executing the command `pnpm build`. Behind this command, `nx` takes control and builds all packages inside of the monorepo. All TypeScript files get transpiled to JavaScript files, and afterwards, these files get bundled with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) for production. A new folder `dist` is created holding the build artifact that can be distributed in each package.

### Releasing a new version

Currently, the release process is pretty minimalistic. The developer must bump the `version` field inside the root `package.json` file and commit the change. Then, a Github Action workflow called `release` is triggered and synces all versions of each `packages.json` file in the packages to the version stated inside the root `package.json`.

In the current state of Essencium we sync all package versions instead of incrementing each version independently. The leading version is always inside the root `package.json` file.
