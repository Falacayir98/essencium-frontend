# Writing a new component

> Some sections are still drafts and marked with a üìù symbol. Feel free to contribute üéâ.

## Location

The files and folder structure follows the [tightly-coupled architecture](https://nordicapis.com/the-difference-between-tight-coupling-and-loose-coupling/). That means that a file should live as close as possible to its context.
In the image below you can see we've a Header component. On the same level we declare its types as well as its test. This is the closest place for those files to the Header component.
The Header component does have other components it uses. Because they're specific to it, they live in the `Header/components` folder and follow the same architecture. The `index.ts` files just export all named imports to the next-level `index.ts`.

## Details

- component name is equal to the file name (both `PascalCase`)

- use functional components instead of class components

```tsx
// ‚ùå
class NewComponent extends PureComponent { ... }

// ‚úÖ
function NewComponent(...) { ... }
```

<details>
<summary>Why? üìù</summary>
...
</details>

- import types with `import type { ... } from ...` syntax

```typescript
// ‚ùå
import { NewType } from ...

// ‚úÖ
import type { NewType } from ...
```

<details>
<summary>Why? üìù</summary>
...
</details>

- check size of imports (i.e. with VSCode plugin [import costs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost)) and reduce where possible (green is fine, red should be reviewed)

<details>
<summary>Why? üìù</summary>
...
</details>

- use function declaration syntax instead of arrow function syntax

```tsx
// ‚ùå
const NewComponent = (...) => { ... }

// ‚úÖ
function NewComponent(...) { ... }
```

<details>
<summary>Why? üìù</summary>
...
</details>

- export the functional component as named export (`export function MyComponent(...)`)

```tsx
// ‚ùå
export default function NewComponent(...) { ... }

// ‚úÖ
export function NewComponent(...) { ... }
```

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

Exporting functions, variables and types via the named export syntax has the advantage of automatic bulk-renaming if needed.
</details>

- type the component's props with a TypeScript `type` and destructure them where possible

```tsx
// ‚ùå
function NewComponent(cmpProps: { username: string; age: number; }) { ... }

// ‚ùå
function NewComponent({ username, age }: { username: string; age: number; }) { ... }

// ‚úÖ
type NewComponentProps = {
  username: string;
  age: number;
}

function NewComponent({ username, age }: NewComponentProps) { ... }
```

<details>
<summary>Why? üìù</summary>
...
</details>

- specify return type of component

```tsx
// ‚ùå
function NewComponent(...) { ... }

// ‚úÖ
function NewComponent(...): JSX.Element { ... }
```

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

By specifying the concret return type, TypeScript will give you an error if you accidentally return a wrong type.
Additionally, it increases the consistency of always specifying the return type of functions throughout the codebase and provides a better readability if you can directly recognize what a function returns.
</details>

- declare types in a separate file on the same level as the component inside a `types.ts` file

<details>
<summary>Why? üìù</summary>
...
</details>

- logic that belongs together should live as close together as possible and they should be separated through a blank line

```tsx
// ‚ùå
function NewComponent(...): JSX.Element {
  const [toggleColorTheme, setToggleColorTheme] = useState('light')
  const { t } = useTranslation()
  function onToggleColorTheme(): void {
    ...
    setToggleColorTheme('dark')
    ...
  }
}

// ‚úÖ
function NewComponent(...): JSX.Element {
  const { t } = useTranslation()

  const [toggleColorTheme, setToggleColorTheme] = useState('light')

  function onToggleColorTheme(): void {
    ...
    setToggleColorTheme('dark')
    ...
  }
}
```

- separate JSX elements with a blank line if they have the same indentation

```tsx
// ‚ùå
function NewComponent(...): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h2> Foo </h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3> Bar </h3>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

// ‚úÖ
function NewComponent(...): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h2> Foo </h2>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3> Bar </h3>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<details>
<summary>Why? üìù</summary>
...
</details>

- lazy load components if it makes sense

<details>
<summary>Why? üìù</summary>
...
</details>

- all texts are replaced with a corresponding `i18n` variable

```tsx
// ‚ùå
<h3> Login </h3>

// ‚úÖ
<h3> {t('login.title')} </h3>
```

<details>
<summary>Why? üìù</summary>
...
</details>

- no TypeScript `any`

```tsx
// ‚ùå
function NewComponent(...): JSX.Element {
  const { t } = useTranslation()

  const [user, setUser] = useState<any>({ name: '', email: '' })
}

// ‚úÖ
// types.ts
export type User = {
  name: string
  email: string
}

// NewComponent.tsx
import type { User } from './types'

function NewComponent(...): JSX.Element {
  const { t } = useTranslation()

  const [user, setUser] = useState<User>({ name: '', email: '' })
}
```

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>
By telling TypeScript that a variable or function is of type `any` you disable TypeScript for it and don't get any type-safety anymore.
Some typing is hard, we all know that, but at least ask for help and don't go the simple and insecure way.
</details>

- treat server requests as sensible

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>
Double-check if you make unnecessary or too many server requests caused by a suboptimal implementation. It could led to a bad performance and UX.
</details>

- provide feedback for every write, delete, update operation

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>
A good UX consists of proper user feedback i.e. notifications. That gives the user confidence that his action was successful or has failed.
</details>

- proper code formatting via Prettier & linting via ESLint

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>
Tools like Prettier (semantic) and ESLint (syntax) ensure a consistent codebase and keeo readability on a high level.
</details>

- check console (browser and terminal) for any errors or warnings

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>
Even though your implementation is fine, warning or even error can occur. Sometimes they're not reflected in the UI but in the console.
</details>

## Example 

```tsx
// NewComponent.tsx

import type { User } from './types'  

export function NewComponent({name, email}: User): JSX.Element {
  const { t } = useTranslation()

  const [user, setUser] = useState<User>({ name: '', email: '' })
